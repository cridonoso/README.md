## About Me :raising_hand:

I am a research assistant in Computer Science with more than **5 years of experience**, with a focus on Data Science. Currently applying **Deep Learning** on **Astrophysics** problems.

My long experience in Astronomy has taught me to tackle challenging tasks and extrapolate knowledge to other fields of application, such as **text analysis**, **biology**, and the **forest industry**.

For a detailed trajectory of my academic and professional work, please check my [CV](https://github.com/cridonoso/cridonoso/blob/main/donoso-cv-oct-2024.pdf)

## Research Interests :mag:
- Computer Vision
- Time Series
- Representation Learning
- Large Language Models (LLM)
