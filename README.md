## About Me :raising_hand:

I am a research assistant in Computer Science with 5 years of experience, with a focus on Data Science. Currently applying deep learning on Astrophysics problems.

My long experience in Astronomy has taught me to tackle challenging tasks and extrapolate knowledge to other fields of application, such as text analysis, biology, and the forest industry.

For a detailed trajectory of my academic and professional work, please check my [CV](https://github.com/cridonoso/cridonoso/blob/main/donoso-cv-oct-2024.pdf)
